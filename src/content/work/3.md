The website for Sierras del Tirol was built using Astro and deployed on Vercel, designed as a fast, fully static landing page. Its purpose is to bring visibility to the issues affecting the area and to present the local neighbors as a united community. The site is purely informational, offering context about the zone, community initiatives, and contact options.

All animations and visual effects were crafted using pure CSS, resulting in a lightweight yet dynamic browsing experience. The clean layout, responsive design, and smooth transitions contribute to the clarity and impact of the message, making the site both accessible and engaging across all devices.
