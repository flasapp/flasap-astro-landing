This landing page for a barbershop was developed in 2018 using AngularJS, offering a clean and direct user experience. The site presents essential information about the business—services, pricing, and contact details—designed to be accessible and mobile-friendly.

It includes an integrated booking system, allowing clients to schedule appointments online quickly and easily. Despite being built with a legacy framework, the site remains functional and lightweight, tailored for simplicity and effective customer engagement.
