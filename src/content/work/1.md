The Alaska Congelados website was built using modern, efficient technologies to deliver a fast, clean, and fully responsive experience. The frontend was developed with Svelte, styled using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, resulting in a lightweight interface optimized for usability. The site includes typical e-commerce features such as product filters, search functionality, shopping cart, and product detail pages, all designed for smooth user interaction.

The backend was developed in PHP, and the system includes an admin panel built with Vue and PrimeVue, allowing the client to manage products, prices, images, and stock with ease. All content is fully self-managed, providing flexibility and independence to keep the site updated without technical assistance. The development prioritized simplicity, performance, and maintainability, without the need for third-party integrations.
