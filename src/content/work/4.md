This financial backoffice for a housing cooperative was developed in 2025 using Vue 3 with PrimeVue for the frontend, and a Node.js backend connected to a MariaDB database. The platform centralizes all financial operations, allowing administrators to manage payment records, subsidies, debts, and generate detailed account reports for each member.

The interface is clean, responsive, and designed for clarity and efficiency, enabling fast access to key financial data. The system includes filtering, exporting, and user role management, supporting daily administrative tasks while ensuring data integrity and traceability. Built for internal use, it streamlines cooperative finances in a secure and scalable way.
